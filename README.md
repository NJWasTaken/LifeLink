This repository contains the problem statement, outline of our app idea, prototype and our final presentation.

### The Vision
Imagine if Twitter met Duolingo to create a healthcare experience that's not just about treating illnesses but also about promoting wellness and building a healthier and more medically aware community. LifeLink is more than just an app; it's a lifestyle revolution. Our vision is to create a seamless, engaging, and holistic healthcare ecosystem that empowers individuals to take control of their health and well-being through learning and socialising.

### The Problem
#### Revolutionizing healthcare through an integrated mobile platform: empowering individuals, communities, and reshaping the future of well-being.
- Lack of Awareness and Education
- Escalating Health Risks
- Dearth of Actionable Solutions
- Promoting Sustainable Healthy Lifestyles
- Fostering Community Engagement and Advocacy
- Bridging the Information Gap

### The Solution
LifeLink is a multifaceted app that aims to tackle all of these issues at once. Let's explore the four tabs that make up the core of LifeLink:

#### Profile Page
